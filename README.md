# ðŸŒž Daily Quote dApp â€” Built on Algorand

Welcome to **Daily Quote**, a simple decentralized application (dApp) built on the Algorand blockchain. This project showcases how you can store and update an inspiring quote each day using smart contracts written in TypeScript.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description

The **Daily Quote dApp** is a motivational Web3 tool that allows anyone to:
- **View** a daily quote stored on-chain.
- **Set** a new quote for the current day (once per day).

This dApp is perfect for learning how to build simple smart contracts using the [@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript) package. It demonstrates global state management, input validation, and interaction with the Algorand blockchain â€” all in TypeScript!

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Stores a **daily quote** in the smart contract's global state.
- Tracks the **last date** the quote was updated.
- Prevents multiple updates within the same day.
- Anyone can read the quote â€” optionally, you can restrict who can set it.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Easy-to-understand smart contract logic  
âœ… Written entirely in **TypeScript**  
âœ… Uses **GlobalState** for storage  
âœ… Beginner-friendly structure  
âœ… Perfect starting point for learning Algorand smart contracts  
âœ… Can be expanded to include quote history, admin-only access, or a frontend

## ðŸ”— Deployed Smart Contract

**Algorand Smart Contract Address:** `XXX`  
_(Replace this with your actual deployed contract address when ready)_

## ðŸ§  Smart Contract Code

```ts
import { Contract, GlobalState } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class DailyQuote extends Contract {
  // Global state to store the daily quote
  quote = GlobalState<string>({ key: "quote", initialValue: "Start your day with a smile!" });

  // Global state to store last updated date (e.g., "2025-09-06")
  lastUpdated = GlobalState<string>({ key: "lastUpdated", initialValue: "" });

  // Update the daily quote (for simplicity, anyone can update)

  setQuote(newQuote: string, today: string): string {
    
    return newQuote;
  }



  // Get the current quote
  getQuote(): string {
    return this.quote.value;
  }
}
